# GoogleDriveSync
Small tool to synchronize a file structure to a Google Drive account

This tool written in Java solved my problem of synchornizing a directory structure to Google Drive, 
where the offical Google Drive utils only syncronize an entire account, this tool will perform
one-way syncronization of a selected subdirectory.

State: BETA quality, use at own risk!

Before use:
Specify $HOME/.GoogleDriveProperties:
accountID = youraccount@gmail.com
clientID = clientID
clientSecret = clientSecret
